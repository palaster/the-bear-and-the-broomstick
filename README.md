# The Bear and the Broomstick

Youâ€™re a human who can become a dragon. The human is good at fighting, with limited mobility. The dragon is good at flying, but clumsy in combat. This takes place in a small + dense open world where exploration is rewarded. My goal is to have seamless transitions between combat, exploration, & movement.

Right now you can only explore a small set of floating islands. This will change in the near future.
